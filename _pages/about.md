## Introduction
<img src='/images/roboPic.jpg'>{: align-right width="300px"}
My name is Aaron Omadutt, I am a recent graduate from Swarthmore College with a B.S. in Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics. My academic and practical experience has provided me with a strong foundation in engineering principles and mathematical analysis, which I have applied to a variety of projects.


## Education

I graduated in May 2024 with a GPA of 3.30. My coursework included Thermofluid Mechanics, Aerodynamics, Computer-Aided Manufacturing and Procedural Design, Dynamics of Mechanical Systems, Mechanics, Linear Physical Systems Analysis, Experimentation for Engineering Design, Modeling, Stochastic and Numerical Methods, all which have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering.

## Experience

As an Undergraduate R&D Engineer at Swarthmore College, I developed a robotic model to replicate the swimming techniques of barnacle larvae, focusing on hydrodynamic analysis to investigate the significance of body extensions. This project involved optimizing nitinol springs for actuation, integrating microcontrollers with 3D-printed components, and designing a compact robotic system. I presented this research at the SICB Conference, where I was recognized as a Best Student Presentation Finalist.

## Skills
Some notable technologies I proficient in include: Fusion360, SolidWorks, Minitab and OpenRocket.  I am also skilled in programming languages such as MATLAB, Python, Java, and C/C++. My prototyping and fabrication skills include 3D printing, CNC machining, and PCB schematic design.
